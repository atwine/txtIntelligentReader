UGANDA 3RD IDSR TECHNICAL GUIDELINES

INTEGRATED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) is a strategy that promotes the rational use of resources by integrating common surveillance functions of multiple diseases and health conditions.

1.1 Background

Uganda adopted the IDSR strategy in 2000 as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the African Region.

The strategy focuses on improving surveillance and response activities at all levels of the health system.

2.0 OBJECTIVES

The main objective of IDSR is to strengthen disease surveillance and response systems.

Specific objectives include:
- To detect disease outbreaks early
- To confirm suspected cases through laboratory diagnosis
- To respond promptly to disease outbreaks
- To monitor disease trends over time

2.1 Priority Diseases

The following diseases are considered priority for surveillance:
- Cholera
- Dysentery
- Typhoid fever
- Meningitis
- Yellow fever
- Viral hemorrhagic fevers
- Malaria
- Tuberculosis
- HIV/AIDS

3.0 SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES

Surveillance activities include case detection, reporting, investigation, and response.

3.1 Case Detection

Health workers should be trained to recognize signs and symptoms of priority diseases.

Community health workers play a crucial role in early detection of cases.

3.2 Laboratory Confirmation

Laboratory confirmation is essential for accurate diagnosis.

Specimens should be collected according to standard procedures.

Results should be communicated promptly to relevant authorities.

4.0 RESPONSE MEASURES

Response measures depend on the type of disease and severity of the outbreak.

Immediate response includes case management and infection control measures.

Public health measures may include vaccination campaigns and health education.

4.1 Case Management

Patients should receive appropriate treatment according to national guidelines.

Severe cases may require hospitalization and specialized care.

Contact tracing should be conducted for communicable diseases.

5.0 REPORTING SYSTEM

The reporting system follows a hierarchical structure from health facilities to national level.

Weekly reports should be submitted even when no cases are detected.

Electronic reporting systems are being implemented to improve timeliness.

6.0 TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING

Regular training is essential for effective implementation of IDSR.

Training should target health workers at all levels of the health system.

Supervisory visits help ensure quality of surveillance activities.
